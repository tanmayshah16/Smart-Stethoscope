# Smart-Stethoscope
Analysing Heart Sound using LSTM Algorithm and building Flask Web App for deployment.

# Dataset
The dataset comprises of 900 Normal/Murmur/ExtraSystole/Artifacts heart sound wav files. It was collected from http://www.peterjbentley.com/heartchallenge/

# Background
Heart sounds are the noises generated by the beating heart and the resultant flow of blood through it. In healthy adults, there are two normal heart sounds, often described as a lub and a dub (or dup), that occur in sequence with each heartbeat. These are the first heart sound (S1) and second heart sound (S2), produced by the closing of the atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves, respectively.

# Requirements
 You can install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
